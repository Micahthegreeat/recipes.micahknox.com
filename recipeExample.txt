Ingredients:
I: butter
A: 1/4 stick
I: american cheese
A: 7 slices
I: hashbrown box
A: 1
I: vegetable oil
A: enough to coat bottom of the pan
I: trail dust
A: depends on size of pan
Steps:
Put hot water in the hashbrown box for 8 and a half minutes. Meanwhile coat the bottom of the pan with vegetable oil. Heat the pan up to about halfway on the stovetop.
Strain the water out of the hashbrowns. Then spread them evenly across the preheated pan. Cook them for about 5 minutes or until you can smell them cooking. Meanwhile start the broiler.
Put the pan in the oven for 5 minutes. Then rotate it 180 degrees and leave it like that for 2.5 minutes. Don't let it burn.
Turn off the broiler. Put 5 equally sliced chips of butter on the pan. Then 5 slices of cheese. Put on 3 shakes of trail dust. Then put the pan back in the oven until the cheese is melted.
Then put it on a plate. Fold it in half so the cheese from the last step is on the inside. Then put the last 2 slices on top, and microwave it for 15 seconds.
