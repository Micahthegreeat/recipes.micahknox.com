    <h2>Step 1</h2>

    </p>
    <h2>Step 2</h2>

    Strain the water out of the hashbrowns. then spread them evenly across the preheated pan. Cook them for about 5 minutes or until you can smell them cooking. Meanwhile start the broiler.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p class = instructions>
    Put the pan in the oven for 5 minutes. Then rotate it 180 degrees and leave it like that for 2.5 minutes. Don't let it burn.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p class = instructions>
    Turn off the broiler. Put 5 equally sliced chips of butter (this is all of it) on the pan. Then 5 slices of cheese. Put on 3 shakes of trail dust on. Then put the pan back in the oven until the cheese is melted.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 5</h2>
    <p class = instructions>
